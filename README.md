# OpenArm Driver

A Python library for controlling [OpenArm](https://github.com/enactic/openarm/), using [OpenArm CAN](https://github.com/enactic/openarm_can/).

## Quick start

TODO

## Install

`openarm-driver` depends on `openarm-can`. 

```bash
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:openarm/main
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  libopenarm-can-dev \
  openarm-can-utils
```

Then:

```bash
pip install openarm-driver
```

## Sample usage

```python
import openarm_driver

arm = openarm_driver.SingleArmDriver("right_arm")
# You can also use your own config file as well.
# config = openarm_driver.Config("/path/to/config.yaml")
# arm = openarm_driver.SingleArmDriver("right_arm", config)

try:
    arm.start()
    while True:
        cur_position = arm.fetch_position()
        # Some process to calculate the next steps.
        next_positions = inference(cur_position)
        for next_postion in next_positions:
            arm.smooth_move(next_postion, hz=50, duration=1)
            # you can use simple command as well (Please be careful not to move the arm too much).
            # arm.send_position(next_postion)
finally:
    arm.stop()
```

## Config

Please refer to [src/openarm_driver/config.yaml](src/openarm_driver/config.yaml), the default configuration.
